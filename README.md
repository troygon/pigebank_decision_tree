# Pig E. Bank Decision Tree
Decision Tree for Pig E Bank


## Context and Objective

One of the data analysts for the sales team recently left Pig E. Bank, so you’ve agreed to take their place and help out with a customer retention project.

To increase customer retention, the sales team wants to identify the leading indicators that a customer will leave the bank. You’ve created a table of client attributes that you believe could indicate whether customers will leave—for example, age, estimated salary, etc. You’re going to use this information to identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree.
